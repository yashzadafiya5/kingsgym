            <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/income.asp">income</a>
            <p>Income refers to the money that a person or entity receives in exchange for their labor or products. Income may have different definitions depending on the context—for example, taxation, financial accounting, or economic analysis. </p></div>
        <div class="expenses">
            <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expense.asp">expenses</a>
            <p> An expense is the cost of operations that a company incurs to generate revenue. As the popular saying goes, “it costs money to make money.”
            Common expenses include payments to suppliers, employee wages, factory leases, and equipment depreciation. Businesses are allowed to write off tax-deductible expenses on their income tax returns to lower their taxable income and thus their tax liability. However, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has strict rules on which expenses businesses are allowed to claim as a deduction. </p></div>
        <div class="profit"><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profit.asp">profit</a>
        <p>
            Profit describes the financial benefit realized when revenue generated from a business activity exceeds the expenses, costs, and taxes involved in sustaining the activity in question.
